### Code:
***1. Sat_solve***
   
+ ***solve.py***: Implementation code for Algorithm 4("Solving the system constructed by the superpolys by testing").
    + ***l285***: Generate test key;
    + ***l289***: Specify test key (hexadecimal);
    + ***Program output***: After selecting the input data, the calculation will output such information:
        + ***'round'***: The current variable being tested;
        + ***'untested vars'***: The remaining set of variables that need to be tested;
        + ***'to test var'***: The variable name currently being tested;
        + ***'current_assigns'***: The set of variables with determined values,e,g,[59] -> k59=1, [-62] -> k62=0;
        + ***'both_has_solutions'***: The set of variables whose values cannot be determined temporarily;
        + ***'output result'***: No solution is found when testing  k_{62} == 1, this indicates that k62=0.
